    <p>
        HTML elements can be placed inside, or nested within, one another. Nested elements are generally put on a new
        line and tabbed in for clarity when reading the code. The general syntax of nesting an element b inside an 
        element a is:
    </p>
        {% include 'HTML/home/includes/code_snippets/nesting_syntax.html' %}
    <p>
        A good example of where this seems obvious is if you want to highlight a word or phrase in a paragraph by 
        making it bold, whilst leaving the rest of the paragraph as normal. To achieve this you can start the paragraph 
        element until you get up to the word that you want to bold, start the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;em&gt;</code>
         element, write the word, end the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;/em&gt;</code>
         element and then continue the rest of the paragraph. This will look like:
    </p>
        {% include 'HTML/home/includes/code_examples/nesting_example.html' %}

    <p>
        Elements that are nested immediately inside of another element have the relationship of a parent and child. In 
        the above example the
        <code class="written-code">&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</code>
        element is the child of the
        <code class="written-code">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        element. If there were other child elements of the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        element, these would be sibling elements to the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</code>
        element. If the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</code>
        element had any child elements of it's own, these would be grandchild elements of the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        element. See, HTML is all about building a big happy family.
