    <p>
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
         is the foundational language of the web, used to structure and display content on webpages. The web document 
        structure is defined through elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. 
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML forms the backbone of web development, combined with 
        <dfn title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</dfn>
        (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity). Web browsers interpret HTML documents to render them as 
        visible web pages. The combination of these languages has enabled the explosive growth of the internet, 
        transforming how information is shared, communicated, and accessed worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section on HTML I will outline typical elements, 
        <dfn title="To give meaning to">Semantic</dfn>
         HTML elements that describe their purpose such as 
        <code class="html">&lt;article&gt;</code>
         or 
        <code class="html">&lt;header&gt;</code>
        , and examples, culminating in a usable HTML page template that will help you hit the ground running with 
        building your own webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Browsers interpret elements in a document as instructions for displaying content. These elements define 
        structure and formatting, such as marking text as a heading, paragraph, bold, list, or table. Despite the 
        complexity of modern web applications, they are still built on this fundamental structure and even web pages 
        created in 1991 remain fully functional in today's browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML documents are plain text files saved with a .html extension and consist of elements and 
        <dfn title="Variables that provide additional information about an elementâ€™s behaviour or appearance">attributes</dfn>.
         They can be edited with any text editor and run in any browser. For all things HTML and for a full description 
         of things that I barely scratch the surface of on this site, I highly recommend the 
        <a class="text-link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" aria-label="Go to the W3Schools webpage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools</a>
         HTML documentation.
