    <!--Set up repository-->
    <h4>Step 1: Set up the Repository</h4>
    <p>
        Set up a repository on GitHub and then clone it. More on this can be found 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="{% url 'full_stack_github' %}#intro-to-full-stack-github-creating-a-repository"
            title="Go to the GitHub section on creating repositories"
            aria-label="Go to the GitHub section on creating repositories"
        >
            here
        </a>
        in the GitHub section of this site.
    </p>

    <!--Venv-->
    <h4>Step 2: Set up the Virtual Environment</h4>
    <p>
        Create a virtual envionment from your terminal so that all of your app requirements are kept together and
        will not create unwanted interactions with other libraries or requirements on your system as a whole.
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/venv.html' %}
    <p>
        You can then activate it (each time you load up your workspace) with:
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/venv_activate.html' %}
    <p>
        You can deactivate it at any time with:
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/venv_deactivate.html' %}
    
    <!--Packages-->
    <h4>Step 3: Install Packages</h4>
    <p>
        Install the following packages required for the project.
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/packages.html' %}
    <p>
        Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that integrates SQLAlchemy with your Flask app, which is an
        <dfn title="Object Relational Mapper">ORM</dfn>
        for Python. It provides a database connection, an easy way to define models, and helper methods to query, 
        insert, update, and delete records.
    </p>
    <p>
        psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python that allows your Flask app (via SQLAlchemy) to talk to a 
        PostgreSQL database.
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/troubleshooting/troubleshoot_packages.html' %}

    <!--env-->
    <h4>Step 4: Create an env.py File</h4>
    <p>
        Create an env.py file in your root directory to house your environment variables. Create it like this.
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/env.html' %}

    <!--.gitignore-->
    <h4>Step 5: Create a .gitignore File</h4>
    <p>
        Make a .gitignore file in your root directory and add env.py into this file to keep your environment variables
        from being uploaded to GitHub. 
    </p>

    <!--init-->
    <h4>Step 6: Set up the Project Folder</h4>
    <p>
        Create the application its own python package by making a new folder in root directory and give it the name of 
        your project. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a file inside this folder named __init__.py. This file is a special Python file that initialises a 
        Python package and is typically used to create the Flask application instance and set up configuration, 
        extensions (like SQLAlchemy), and Blueprints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside this file:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Import os, flask, SQL modules, and an if statement to find the env.py. This if statement is important
                because when deployed, this file is not uploaded to GitHub and will thus not be found, causing an error
                without this statement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your app will be an instance of the Flask app, so create this, and specify the environment variables 
                that come from your env.py file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an instance of SQLAlchemy class and name it as db to use as your database.
            </li>
            <li>
                Import the URLs (known as routes in Flask) from your project. Note we have not created these yet. This 
                is improted after creating the instance of the database (instead of the top of the file with the other 
                imports), as it will rely on the above variables.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/init.html' %}

    <!--Routes-->
    <h4>Step 7: Create the Routes</h4>
    <p>
        In Flask, routes define the URLs your web application will respond to, and map them to Python functions that 
        handle the request and return a response.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a routes.py file in your project_name folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside this file:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Import render_template, app, and your database.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a route. I have added a basic one named home that will display a base.html file when called.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/routes.html' %}

    <!--Run-->
    <h4>Step 8: Create a run.py file</h4>
    <p>
        In the root directory create a run.py file. This file will import your flask apps and run the project.
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/run.html' %}
    <ul>
        <li>
            The
            <code class="written-code">if __name__</code>"
            snippet checks if the run.py file is being run directly and if so runs the app with the required settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">host=os.environ.get("IP")</code>
            gets the IP address from the environment variables defined in the env.py file via the __init__.py file.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">port=int(os.environ.get("PORT"))</code>
            gets the port number (string) and converts it to an integer for use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">debug=os.environ.get("DEBUG")</code>
            tries to enable or disable debug mode based on the   environment variable.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!--Templates-->
    <h4>Step 9: Create the Templates</h4>
    <p>
        In your project_name folder, create a folder named templates. In here create base.html. This filename is called
        in the route defined in Step 7.
    </p>
    <p>
        In base.html add some HTML boilerplate (if using VSCode you can type html:5 and press <kbd>tab</kbd>) and then
        add something to the body.
    </p>

    <!--Run-->
    <h4>Step 10: Run your Project</h4>
    <p>
        Now run your project to make sure that it works. In the terminal enter:
    </p>
    {% include 'flask_app/basics/includes/code_snippets/run_test.html' %}
    <p>
        Then you can <kdb>ctrl</kdb> + <kbd>click</kbd> on either http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://100.127.255.249:5000
        (or similar) to open your project in your browser. To close this, in the terminal press <kdb>ctrl</kdb> + 
        <kbd>C</kbd>.
    </p>
