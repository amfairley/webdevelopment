    <p>
        Create a route to handle the deletion of the data. We do not need a template for this, as we can put the delete
        button wherever we like. Ensure to include an identifying variable (here we use cateogry_id) in order to query
        the correct record for deletion. Then do the delete -> save -> redirect pathway.
