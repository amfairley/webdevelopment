        <abbr title="Too Long; Didn’t Read. A quick summary of what follows.">TL;DR</abbr>:
        Declarative programming describes what should happen 
        (<abbr title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, 
        <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>), 
        while imperative programming 
        defines how it happens (JavaScript, Python). Declarative code is like ordering a pizza—just say what you want. 
        Imperative code is like making the pizza—following a recipe step by step.
    </p>
    <p>
        Software development follows different 
        <dfn title="A methodology or way to approach programming.">paradigms</dfn>, 
        two of the most fundamental being declarative programming and imperative programming. These approaches shape 
        how developers write code, structure logic, and solve problems. While declarative programming focuses on what 
        should happen, imperative programming is concerned with how it happens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Declarative programming is all about specifying the desired outcome without worrying about the exact steps 
        needed to achieve it. Common examples include 
        <abbr title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, 
        and 
        <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>,
         where the developer provides high-level 
        instructions that another system interprets. For instance, writing 
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code> 
        in 
        <abbr title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 
        tells the browser to display a heading, but the underlying details of rendering it are abstracted away. 
        Similarly, a 
        <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>
        query like 
        <code class="written-code">SELECT * FROM users</code> 
        retrieves data without specifying how the database should process the request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imperative programming, on the other hand, requires step-by-step instructions to achieve a result. Languages 
        like JavaScript and Python follow this 
        <dfn title="A methodology or way to approach programming.">paradigm</dfn>, 
        executing sequenced instructions 
        (<dfn title="Steps in a recipe.">algorithms</dfn>) 
        and using mutable data 
        (<dfn title="The ingredients in a recipe.">variables</dfn>) 
        that change over time. Unlike declarative programming, imperative code includes logic and decision-making 
        within its instructions, explicitly defining how a task is performed.
    </p>
    <p>
        A restaurant analogy helps illustrate the difference. When ordering a pizza, a customer simply states what they 
        want—the desired outcome—without specifying the steps required to make it. This represents declarative 
        programming, where users are shielded from implementation details. However, in the kitchen, the chef must 
        follow a detailed recipe, adding ingredients in a specific order to achieve the final dish. This step-by-step 
        process mirrors imperative programming, where the focus is on how the result is produced.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both 
        <dfn title="A methodology or way to approach programming.">paradigms</dfn>
        play essential roles in software development. Declarative programming simplifies code by focusing on outcomes, 
        while imperative programming provides full control over execution. Most modern applications blend both 
        approaches, leveraging their strengths depending on the task at hand.
