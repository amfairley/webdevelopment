        Getting started with collaboration on GitHub might seem a little intimidating, but once you understand how the 
        different aspects of collaboration work, such as inviting teammates, making forks, creating pull requests, and 
        handling merge conflicts, it all starts to click. Collaboration on GitHub is basically all about communicating 
        clearly and being kind to your future self (and teammates) with clean commits and clear pull requests. Once you 
        get into the rhythm, it becomes second nature.
    </p>
    <!--Adding collaborators-->
    <h4>
        Adding Collaborators
    </h4>
    <p>
        If you're working on a small project with a few people you trust, the easiest way to collaborate is to add them 
        directly to your repository. Here's how:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to your repo on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Click Settings > Collaborators.</li>
        <li>Under the “Manage access” section of the page, hit “Add people” and enter their GitHub username, full name, or email.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once they accept, they'll have permission to push changes directly to the repo. 
    </p>
    {% include 'intro_to_full_stack/github/includes/troubleshooting/add_to_repo.html' %}
    <p>
        For safety, especially on bigger projects, you can protect your main branch so no one accidentally breaks anything:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Go to Settings > Branches > Add branch ruleset
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Select your main branch and check options like Require pull request reviews before merging. This ensures that 
        all changes go through a review process first. For more examples see the pages for

    <!--Forking a repository-->
    <h4>
        Forking a Repository
    </h4>
    <p>
        If you don't want to give someone direct access, or if you're contributing to someone else's project, forking 
        is the way to go. Forking creates a copy of the upstream repository under your GitHub account, so you can work 
        on it without affecting the original project. For full information, see the 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="http://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks"

        >
            forks
        </a>
        section of the documentation. Outlined here is my general experience with them.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the grey “Fork” button on the top right of the repository page and select “+ Create a new fork”. This makes a copy of the repository on your GitHub profile.</li>
        <li>Clone this forked repository (from your GitHub profile) onto your IDE in the usual way.</li>
        <li>
            Create a branch for your changes using
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code class="written-code">git checkout -b your-branch-name</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Make your changes and push them
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code class="written-code">git push origin your-branch-name</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            To keep your fork updated, make sure to add the original repo as a remote.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code class="written-code">
                        git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git
                    </code>
                    <code class="written-code">
                        git pull upstream main
                    </code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <!--Pull Requests-->
    <h4>
        Pull Requests
    </h4>
    <p>
        Once you've pushed a branch with your changes, GitHub usually shows a "Compare & Pull Request" button. This is 
        where the real collaboration begins.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a pull request you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe what you changed and why</li>
        <li>Explain how you tested it</li>
        <li>Link to any issues it solves (just type #issue-number from the associated Project)</li>
        <li>Assign reviewers, so your teammates know to take a look</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are a couple of ways the code can be merged once it's approved:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Merge Commit: Keeps the history and shows all the commits.</li>
        <li>Squash and Merge: Combines your commits into one clean entry (great for tidy repos).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If a reviewer requests changes, just make your edits locally and push again — GitHub will automatically update 
        the pull request. Once your pull request is merged, don't forget to sync your main branch again wit
        <code class="written-code">git checkout main</code>
        and
        <code class="written-code">git pull origin main</code>.
    </p>
    <!--Merge Conflicts-->
    <h4>
        Merge Conflicts
    </h4>
    <p>
        Merge conflicts occur when two or more developers try to merge changes they have made from their forked 
        repository to the upstream main repository but having made different changes. For instance if one developer 
        changes <i>Functionality A</i> and merges it, but another developer is working on another aspect of 
        <i>Functionality A</i> from the original repository, when they come to merge the same file, it will not include 
        all the changes to <i>Functionality A</i> that the first developer made.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can also occur if two developers make changes to the same line of code.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the first case the second developer can:
    </p>
    <p>Sync your main branch:</p>
    {% include 'intro_to_full_stack/github/includes/code_snippets/merge_1.html' %}
    <p>Switch back to your working branch:</p>
    {% include 'intro_to_full_stack/github/includes/code_snippets/merge_2.html' %}
    <p>Rebase your changes:</p>
    {% include 'intro_to_full_stack/github/includes/code_snippets/merge_3.html' %}
    <p>
        Git will point out the conflict. Open the file, look for the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code>
        markers, and manually resolve the conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once resolved:
    </p>
    {% include 'intro_to_full_stack/github/includes/code_snippets/merge_4.html' %}
    <p>
        In the second case (the same line of code is changed by 2 developers) you try to pull changes, but Git can't 
        merge them automatically. Here's how to deal with it:
    </p>
    <p>
        Look at the commit history:
    </p>
    {% include 'intro_to_full_stack/github/includes/code_snippets/merge_5.html' %}
    <p>
        If your local branch is out of sync, reset it:
    </p>
    {% include 'intro_to_full_stack/github/includes/code_snippets/merge_6.html' %}
