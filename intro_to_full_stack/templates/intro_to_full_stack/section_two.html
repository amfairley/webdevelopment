        HTML, the 
        <span class="title" title="Text with links enabling navigation between documents or webpages.">Hypertext</span>
         Markup Language, revolutionized information sharing. Its roots trace back to the General Markup Language (GML), 
         developed in the 1960s to structure machine-readable documents. Later standardised as 
        <span class="title" title="Standardised General Markup Language.">SGML</span>, 
        it introduced headings, paragraphs, and tablesâ€”but lacked 
        <span class="title" title="Text with links enabling navigation between documents or webpages.">hypertext</span>.

        In the late 1980s, physicists at 
        <span class="title" title="European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN</span> 
        needed a way to organize and share research. Tim Berners-Lee, a CERN researcher, proposed a system where 
        documents could be interconnected via clickable links rather than static downloads. This idea, inspired by 
        <span class="title" title="Text with links enabling navigation between documents or webpages.">hypertext</span>, 
        led him to develop HTTP 
        (<span class="title" title="Text with links enabling navigation between documents or webpages.">Hypertext</span>
         Transfer Protocol) and HTML, based on SGML but with added hyperlink capabilities.

        Berners-Lee also built the first web browser and web server, enabling researchers to access linked documents 
        across a global network. Encouraging others to expand on his ideas, HTML rapidly evolved, leading to the 
        explosive growth of the World Wide Web within just five years.
