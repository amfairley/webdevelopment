    <p>
        In web design, colour can be defined in multiple ways, and each format offers different advantages. The most 
        common formats are 
        <dfn title="A base-16 alphanumeric system">hexadecimal</dfn> 
        codes, 
        <dfn title="Red Green Blue">RBG</dfn>,
        <dfn title="Red Green Blue Alpha">RGBA</dfn>,
        <dfn title="Hue Saturation Lightness">HSL</dfn>,
        <dfn title="Hue Saturation Lightness Alpha">HSLA</dfn>,
        and keyword colour names.
    </p>

    <!--Hexadecimal Colours-->
    <h4 id="intro-to-full-stack-colour-defining-colours-hexadecimal-colours">Hexadecimal Colours</h4>
    <p>
        Hexadecimal colour codes, or hex codes, are among the most widely used formats in web design. They consist of 
        six characters prefixed with a hash symbol (#). These six characters are split into three pairs, representing 
        the red, green, and blue (RGB) colour values respectively. Each pair is a number in base 16 (hexadecimal), 
        ranging from 00 (minimum intensity) to FF (maximum intensity).
    </p>
    <p>
        For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            #000000 = black (no colour intensity)
        </li>
        <li>
            #FFFFFF = white (maximum colour intensity for all three components)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each component pair contributes to the final colour.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            #FF0000 = pure red
        </li>
        <li>
            #00FF00 = pure green
        </li>
        <li>
            #0000FF = pure blue
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A shorthand version is possible if both numbers in the pairs are the same by defining it once. For instance:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            #FFFFFF can be written as #FFF
        </li>
        <li>
            #00FFFF can be written as #0FF
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Hex codes can also include opacity values using 8-digit hex notation where the last two characters (00 to FF) 
        represent the alpha (opacity) channel like so:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            #00000000 = fully transparent black
        </li>
        <li>
            #FFFFFFFF = fully opaque white  
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!--RGB and RGBA-->
    <h4 id="intro-to-full-stack-colour-defining-colours-rgb-and-rgba">RGB and RGBA</h4>
    <p>
        RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. This format defines colours based on numeric intensity values ranging from 0 
        (no intensity) to 255 (full intensity). The syntax is looks like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">rgb(255, 0, 0); /* bright red */</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        RGBA extends this format by adding Alpha (opacity), a value between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 
        (fully opaque).
    </p>
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); /* semi-transparent red */</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        RGBA is especially useful when layering elements or applying effects like hover or background overlays without 
        changing the underlying colour entirely.
    </p>

    <!--HSL and HSLA-->
    <h4 id="intro-to-full-stack-colour-defining-colours-hsl-and-hsla">HSL and HSLA</h4>
    <p>
        HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness, offering a more intuitive way to represent colours compared to 
        RGB. The syntax looks like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">hsl(hue, saturation%, lightness%);</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hue is the type of colour, represented by an angle from 0 to 360.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Red = 0&deg; (or 360&deg;)
        </li>
        <li>
            Green = 120&deg;
        </li>
        <li>
            Blue = 240&deg;
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Saturation is the intensity of the colour, expressed as a percentage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lightness determines how light or dark the colour is (0% = black, 100% = white).
    </p>
    <p>
        Combining these can look like <code class="written-code">hsl(240, 100%, 50%); /* vivid blue */</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        HSLA adds the alpha channel for opacity in much the same way as RGBA adds it to RGB. It ranges from 0 
        (completely transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). The syntax for this looks like:
        <code class="written-code">
            hsla(240, 100%, 50%, 0.3); /* semi-transparent vivid blue */
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Many designers prefer HSL because it aligns more naturally with how we perceive colour.
    </p>

    <!--Named Colours-->
    <h4 id="intro-to-full-stack-colour-defining-colours-named-colours">Named Colours</h4>
    <p>
        CSS also supports named colours, also called keyword colours, like red, blue, orange, or lightgreen. These are 
        simple and readable, but limited in variety compared to other formats. A full list can be found 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color"
            title="Go to the Mozilla Developer page of named colours"
            aria-label="Go to the Mozilla Developer page of named colours"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
            here
        </a>
        at the Mozilla Developers Docs. The syntax for this looks like:
        <code class="written-code">color: skyblue;</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are 140+ named colours officially supported in CSS. They are useful for quick prototyping, but for brand 
        consistency or precise design, hex or HSL formats are often preferred.
