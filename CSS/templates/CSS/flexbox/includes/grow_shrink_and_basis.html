    <p>
        Flexbox provides three important properties for controlling how flex items grow or shrink to fit the container; 
        <code class="written-code">flex-grow</code>,
        <code class="written-code">flex-shrink</code>,
        and
        <code class="written-code">flex-basis</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 
        <code class="written-code">flex-grow</code>
        property specifies how much a flex item should grow relative to the other items in the container. The value is 
        a unitless number that acts as a proportion, with a higher number indicating more growth. If all items have a 
        flex-grow of 1, they will share the available space equally.
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/flexbox/includes/code_snippets/flex_grow.html' %}
    <p>
        The 
        <code class="written-code">flex-shrink</code>
        property specifies how much a flex item should shrink when there is not enough space in the container. Like
        <code class="written-code">flex-grow</code>,
        the value is a unitless number, with a higher number indicating more shrinkage.
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/flexbox/includes/code_snippets/flex_shrink.html' %}
    <p>
        The 
        <code class="written-code">flex-basis</code>
        property defines the initial size of a flex item before any growing or shrinking occurs. It can be set to a 
        specific length (such as px, %, em, etc.) or auto (which means the item's size is based on its content).
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/flexbox/includes/code_snippets/flex_basis.html' %}
    <p>
        You can combine 
        <code class="written-code">flex-grow</code>,
        <code class="written-code">flex-shrink</code>,
        and
        <code class="written-code">flex-basis</code>
        into a single shorthand property called 
        <code class="written-code">flex</code>.
        The shorthand allows you to specify the three properties in one line.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means the item will grow at a rate of 1, will not shrink (0), and will start with a width of 200px.
    </p>
