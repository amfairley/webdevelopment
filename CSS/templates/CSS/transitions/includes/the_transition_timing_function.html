    <p>
        The 
        <code class="written-code">transition-timing-function</code>
        property controls the acceleration curve of the transition. This property defines how the transition progresses 
        over time, allowing for effects like easing in and out, or maintaining a constant pace. Common values for 
        <code class="written-code">transition-timing-function</code>
        include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">linear</code>:
            The transition occurs at a constant speed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">ease</code>:
            The transition starts slow, speeds up, and then slows down at the end.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">ease-in</code>:
            The transition starts slowly and speeds up toward the end.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">ease-out</code>:
            The transition starts quickly and slows down toward the end.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">ease-in-out</code>:
            The transition starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and slows down at the end.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This specifies that the transition will start slow, speed up, and then slow down as it completes. If you wish 
        to use a cubic
        <dfn title="Create your own custom timing function">Bezier curve</dfn>,
        you can use the following format:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/transitions/includes/code_snippets/timing_function_2.html' %}
    <p>
        This specifies a custom easing curve, which can result in unique transition effects.
