    <!--Introduction-->
    <p>
        The display property in CSS defines how an element should be displayed on the page. It determines whether an 
        element behaves as a block-level element, an inline element, or something else entirely. The display property 
        can be used to control the layout of an element and its interaction with neighbouring elements. The values that 
        the display property can take are block, inline, inline-block, or none.
    </p>
    <!--Block level elements-->
    <h4>Block-Level Elements</h4>
    <p>
        Block-level elements create a box that extends the full width of their parent container. These elements start 
        on a new line and occupy the full width of their container. Common examples of block-level elements include 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;div&gt;</code>,
        <code class="written-code">&lt;p&gt;</code>,
        <code class="written-code">&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
        <code class="written-code">&lt;ul&gt;</code>,
        and
        <code class="written-code">&lt;section&gt;</code>.
        The primary characteristic of block-level elements is that they push other elements below them, occupying the 
        full horizontal space available.
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/display_and_positioning/includes/html_css_example/block_level_example.html' %}
    <p>
        In the code above, the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;div&gt;</code>
        element will create a block that spans the entire width of its parent element and thus the second
        <code class="written-code">&lt;div&gt;</code>
        will appear on the next line. To set an element as a block if it is not one by default use
        <code class="written-code">display: block;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Block-level elements prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space. This is one of the key 
        differences between block-level elements and inline elements, which allow multiple elements to coexist on the 
        same line.
    </p>
    <!--Inline level elements-->
    <h4>Inline Elements</h4>
    <p>
        Inline elements, on the other hand, do not start on a new line. They only take up as much width as necessary 
        and allow other inline elements to sit next to them horizontally. Examples of inline elements include 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;span&gt;</code>,
        <code class="written-code">&lt;a&gt;</code>,
        <code class="written-code">&lt;strong&gt;</code>,
        and
        <code class="written-code">&lt;em&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/display_and_positioning/includes/html_css_example/inline_level_example.html' %}
    <p>
        In this case, the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;span&gt;</code>
        element will not start on a new line but will instead flow within the paragraph, taking up only as much space 
        as required. To set an element as inline if it is not one by default use 
        <code class="written-code">display: inline;</code>.
    </p>
    <!--Inline block elements-->
    <h4>Inline-Block Elements</h4>
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">inline-block</code>
        is a hybrid between block and inline elements. It allows the element to behave like a block-level element but 
        remain inline with other elements. The element retains its block-level behaviour (it can have width and height),
        but it will stay on the same line as other elements.
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/display_and_positioning/includes/html_css_example/inline_block_level_example.html' %}
    <p>
        Here, all three 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;div&gt;</code>
        elements are aligned horizontally, but each retains block-like properties, such as having specific width and 
        height. To set an element as an inline-block if it is not one by default use
        <code class="written-code">display: inline-block;</code>.
    </p>
    <!--None-->
    <h4>None</h4>
    <p>
        To completely remove an element from the page, set the display to none. This is useful in conjunction with 
        <a class="text-link" href="" aria-label="Go to the media queries section">media queries</a> 
        to remove an element under or above a certain screen size. To set an element as inline if it is not one by 
        default use:
        <code class="written-code">display: none;</code>.
    </p>
