    <p>
        You can also select your elements based on the attributes given to them. You can specify what attribute you are 
        targeting by defining it within square brackets. For instance your external links are likely to be anchor tags 
        with 
        <code class="written-code">target="_blank"</code>
        for them to open in a new tab. In order to target these but not internal links (that will not have a target 
        attribute) you could use:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/selectors/includes/code_snippets/attribute_selector.html' %}
    <p>
        You can also target elements what have a specific value for their attribute by putting the element type before 
        the square brackets and adding the value to the attribute inside the square brackets. Note that there is no 
        space between the HTML element type and the opening square bracket of the attribute. 
    </p>
