        The universal selector (*) selects all the elements on you webpage. This is useful to include at the top of 
        your CSS file so as to remove any unwanted default stylings. I tend to include:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/selectors/includes/code_snippets/universal_selector.html' %}
    <p>
        More about these specific declarations will be discussed later but for now it is enough to know that it resets 
        all the spacing around elements to 0 so that I can work on them from scratch. Otherwise, I find some the 
        spacing is inconsistent across different elements resulting in me having to individually give them these 
        declarations every time an issue crops up.

        Type selectors select all HTML elements of that type. For example all paragraph 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        elements can be selected with:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/selectors/includes/code_snippets/type_selector.html' %}
    <p>
        Class selectors select, well, all of that class. This is where attaching
        <a class="text-link" href="{% url 'HTML_home' %}#HTML-home-ids-and-classes" aria-label="Go to the HTML class section">classes</a>
        in HTML really shows its strengths. To target classes, use a period before the classname as the selector. For 
        instance if you gave specific paragraphs and headings the attribute of class=”green-text”, you could make them 
        all green with the following CSS rule:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/selectors/includes/code_snippets/class_selector.html' %}
    <p>
        ID selectors will target the element that you have given the specific ID attribute value to. Remember, there 
        will only be one element with this ID per page. Target them with the hash/pound/hashtag symbol and the id name. 
        For example giving a title the id of “website title” an underline:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/selectors/includes/code_snippets/id_selector.html' %}
