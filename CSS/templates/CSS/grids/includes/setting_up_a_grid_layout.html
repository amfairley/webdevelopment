    <p>
        To implement a grid layout, you first need to designate a container as a grid by setting its display property 
        to grid. This transforms the container into a grid context for its direct children, known as grid items. 
        Alternatively, using 
        <code class="written-code">display: inline-grid;</code>
        allows the grid container to behave like an inline element while still providing grid layout capabilities.
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/grids/includes/code_snippets/grid_layout.html' %}
    <p>
        In this example, the 
        <code class="written-code">.container</code>
        is set as a grid with specified column and row sizes. The 
        <code class="written-code">grid-template-columns</code>
        property defines two columns with widths of 200px and 300px, respectively. The 
        <code class="written-code">grid-template-rows</code>
        property sets three rows with heights of 10%, 20%, and 600px.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS Grid provides a shorthand property, 
        <code class="written-code">grid-template</code>,
        to define both row and column sizes simultaneously. The syntax for this shorthand is as follows:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/grids/includes/code_snippets/grid_template_1.html' %}
    {% include 'CSS/grids/includes/code_snippets/grid_template_2.html' %}
    <p>
        Here, the first part (200px 300px) defines the row sizes, and the second part (20% 10% 70%) specifies the 
        column sizes.
    </p>
