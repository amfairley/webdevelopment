    <p>
        There are plenty of CSS libraries out there, although I find Bootstrap to be the easiest to get to grips with 
        and the most customisable. Another one I like is 
            <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="https://materializecss.com/"
            title="Go to MaterializeCSS"
            aria-label="Go to the MaterializeCSS"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
            MaterializeCSS
        </a>.
        I actually prefer the components provided by Materialize, however their library is not as extensive as 
        Bootstrap yet. It is best practice not to use more than one Library, as some of their classes may be repeated 
        across them resulting in some errors across your site. However you could copy and download each of the 
        component classes separately and join them in one file, but this may be a bit extreme for simple websites.
