            Bootstrap
        </a>
        is one of the most popular CSS libraries out there. It's a toolkit full of ready-to-use styles and components 
        that help you build websites faster and with less fuss. Instead of writing all your styles from scratch, 
        Bootstrap gives you a solid foundation to work with: things like a responsive grid system, buttons, forms, 
        navbars, modals, and more, all wrapped up in clean, mobile-friendly design.
    </p>
    <p>
        Developers use libraries like Bootstrap because they save time, especially when you're building something 
        quickly or don't want to reinvent the wheel for common UI elements. With Bootstrap, you can get a 
        decent-looking site up and running in no time. That said, there are a few trade-offs. If you rely too heavily 
        on the default styles, your site might end up looking a bit “samey,” and the library itself can add a bit of 
        bloat to your code if you're not careful. Still, it's a great place to start, especially for beginners. There 
        are lots of other CSS frameworks out there, but Bootstrap is one of the most well-known and beginner-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get it to work, you essentially link your project to a collection of Bootstrap CSS rules and JavaScript 
        scripts allowing you to link them by just adding the class names to your elements in HTML.

        Whenever you want to add any feature, component, or functionality, just look at the examples listed in

        On this page I will just go over some of the basics to get you started and explain some uses of the Bootstrap 
        grid system. Including components such as navigation bars, dropdown menus, progress bars, and many others (and 
        customising them) is explained very well in the documentation with excellent examples to suit almost all of 
        your needs, so I will not waste our time by going over them in less detail here.
