    <p>
        One aspect of responsive design you may want to include is to make some elements disappear on smaller or larger 
        screens and only appear above or below a certain screen size. I have used this to change the order of elements 
        when the screen size changes. For instance if I have thing A next to thing B on larger screens but on smaller 
        screens I want thing A underneath thing B, my HTML will look like 
        Thing A (hide small screens, show on big ,col-6), Thing B (col-12 col-lg-6), 
        Thing A (show on small screens, hide on big, col-12). This is done by setting the display (d) to none.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hiding on smaller screens, showing on large:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/bootstrap/includes/code_snippets/hidden_items_1.html' %}
    <p>
        Showing on smaller screens, hiding on large:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/bootstrap/includes/code_snippets/hidden_items_2.html' %}
    <p>
        For my full “Thing A, Thing B” example:
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/bootstrap/includes/code_snippets/hidden_items_3.html' %}
