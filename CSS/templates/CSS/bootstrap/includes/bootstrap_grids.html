    <p>
        Bootstrap uses its own 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="{% url 'CSS_grids' %}"
            aria-label="Go to the CSS grid page"
            title="Go to the CSS grid page"
        > 
            grid
        </a>
        system for page layout and breaks down the page into 12 columns. For something that takes up the full width of 
        the page, you would need the
        <code class="written-code">col-12</code>
        class.
        For two things to each take up half the width, you can have two elements with 
        <code class="written-code">col-6</code>
        classes next to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        The syntax for this is that there needs to be an external 
        <code class="written-code">container</code>
        class element. This then contains 
        <code class="written-code">row</code>
        class elements. Inside these
        <code class="written-code">row</code>
        class elements you can have your 
        <code class="written-code">col</code>
        class elements.
    </p>
    {% include 'CSS/bootstrap/includes/code_snippets/syntax.html' %}
    <p>
        If the 
        <code class="written-code">col</code>
        class elements inside your 
        <code class="written-code">row</code>
        class element does not add up to 12, Bootstrap will not complain and leave the remaining empty space on the 
        right by default. If they add up to more than 12, Bootstrap will put them on the next line (row) down. For 
        instance 2 
        <code class="written-code">col-4</code>s
        and a
        <code class="written-code">col-6</code>
        will result in the 
        <code class="written-code">col-4</code>s
        on the same line with an empty 
        <code class="written-code">col-4</code>
        space on the right and half of the next line taken up by the 
        <code class="written-code">col-6</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want Bootstrap to handle sizing more fluidly, you can use .col without a number (like 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;div class="col"&gt;</code>),
        and it will automatically divide the 
        <code class="written-code">row</code>
        evenly based on how many 
        <code class="written-code">col</code>
        class elements are in it.
