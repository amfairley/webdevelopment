    <p>
        Testing is essential for building reliable, maintainable Django applications. It ensures that your code behaves 
        as expected, prevents regressions, and supports refactoring with confidence. Django provides a powerful test 
        framework built on Python's unittest library, plus features for testing views, models, forms, and integration 
        workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
         The 3 types of tests in Django are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unit tests - Test a single piece of functionality in isolation (e.g., a model method).</li>
        <li>Integration tests - Check that multiple components (e.g., model + form + view) work together.</li>
        <li>Functional tests - Simulate user interactions (e.g., submitting forms in the browser).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When writing tests, start by thinking about the functionality to add. Write small, focused tests for each piece 
        of behaviour.
    </p>
