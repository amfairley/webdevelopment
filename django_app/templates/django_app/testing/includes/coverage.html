        is a handy tool to measure the test coverage, that is which lines of your code were run during the test suite, 
        which lines were not run and which files have functionality that is not covered by any of your tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        This helps you to find untested parts of your code, encourages you to write more complete test suites and 
        improve code reliability and maintainability. This is often used as a metric for continuous development.

        To install:
    </p>
    {% include 'django_app/testing/includes/code_snippets/coverage_install.html' %}
    <p>
        You can then run the tests through coverage with:
    </p>
    {% include 'django_app/testing/includes/code_snippets/coverage_run.html' %}
    <p>
        This will create a report that you can see in your terminal window with:
    </p>
    {% include 'django_app/testing/includes/code_snippets/coverage_report.html' %}
    <p>
        You can also create a HTML report that provides a clear outline of the testing results and coverage with:
    </p>
    {% include 'django_app/testing/includes/code_snippets/coverage_html_report.html' %}
    <p>
        This creates a htmlcov folder, with a index.html file inside. Open this with live viewer to see the results.
    </p>
