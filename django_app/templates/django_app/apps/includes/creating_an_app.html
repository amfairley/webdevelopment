    <p>
        To create an app, run the following in the terminal
    </p>
    {% include 'django_app/apps/includes/code_snippets/startapp.html' %}
    <p>
        This will create a folder in your route directory named app_name. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Go to settings.py and add your app name to the list of
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="{% url 'django_settings' %}#Django-settings-how-tos-adding-apps"
            title="Go to the Installed_Apps section"
            aria-label="Go to the Installed_Apps section"
        >
            INSTALLED_APPS
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        For a project using a backend, go ahead and create a models.py file in the app folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        For apps with templates associated with them (which will be most apps), go ahead and create a folder inside 
        this app folder named 'templates' and another folder inside this with the same name as the app to hold your 
        HTML files. An example route would be app_name/templates/app_name/index.html. This is so that when Django looks 
        for template names, it won't use a template with the same name from another app. We generally want a new 
        template for each part of CRUD so for example there may be multiple delete.html files across your project. To 
        render templates in your app, see the section on 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="#"
            title="Go to the Django Templates page"
            aria-label="Go to the Django Templates page"
        >
            templates 
        </a>
        and
        
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="#"
            title="Go to the Django Views page"
            aria-label="Go to the Django Views page"
        >
            views
        </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also create a urls.py file to handle the routing, linked to the urls.py file in the project_name folder. For 
        example project_name/urls.py might have:
    </p>
    {% include 'django_app/apps/includes/code_snippets/app_urls.html' %}
    <p>
        In your app named HTML would have a urls.py file with:
    </p>
    {% include 'django_app/apps/includes/code_snippets/app_level_urls.html' %}
    <p>
        In this way, the project_name folder urls.py will set up any HTML app urls with the prefix of HTML/. This gives 
        the two urls in the HTML app urls.py file final urls of www.website_name.com/HTML/ and 
        www.website_name.com/HTML/introducing_elements/ respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        More on that can be seen in the    
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="#"
            title="Go to the Django Templates page"
            aria-label="Go to the Django Templates page"
        >
            templates
        </a>
        section and the 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="{% url 'django_urls' %}"
            title="Go the the Django URLs page"
            aria-label="Go the the Django URLs page"
        >
            urls 
        </a>
        section.
