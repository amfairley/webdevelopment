        First ensure that you have created a superuser. Creating a super user to access this interface is 
        straightforward, simply run the following command in the terminal:
    </p>
    {% include 'django_app/admin/includes/code_snippets/create_superuser.html' %}
    <p>
        The first check that is made is whether the User model is set up and migrated correctly. This was done in our 
        initial migration step and should fly by unless the migrations haven't been previously migrated.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will prompt you for a username or to leave blank to use the suggested username taken from the user in the 
        project pathway, then an email address, and then a password and a password confirmation. If the password does 
        not meet Django's default security requirements you may have to enter a stronger password.
    </p>

        To log into the admin page, run the website again using
        <code class="written-code">python manage.py runserver</code>
        and open the website link and add /admin to the end of the URL.  This works because your project folder urls.py 
        has, by default, a /admin route, allowing the admin page to be accessed from the app with the addition /admin 
        to the end of the URL. Log in with your chosen details and have a little look around. It's pretty bare at the 
        moment but by clicking on the 'Users' link you should see your superuser details along with a green tick 
        under the staff status.
    </p>
