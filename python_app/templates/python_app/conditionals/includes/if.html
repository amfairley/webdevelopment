    <p>
        The simplest form of a conditional in Python looks like this:
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/conditionals/includes/code_snippets/if_1.html' %}
    <p>
        This tells Python: "If the value of age is 18 or more, then print the message."
    </p>
    <p>
        Indentation matters in Python, the code block that belongs to the if statement must be indented.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes you want to check if a certain item exists within a larger group, like a character in a string or an 
        item in a list.
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/conditionals/includes/code_snippets/if_2.html' %}
    <p>
        This works with other iterables too:
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/conditionals/includes/code_snippets/if_3.html' %}
