    <p>
        Python lists are a versatile and common data types. You can store a sequence of elements (numbers, strings, or 
        even other lists) in order and manipulate them easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lists are defined with square brackets and the elements are separated by commas.

    <p>
        You can also create an empty list by not putting any values between the square brackets. This is useful for 
        when you need to create a list within a function; define an empty list beforehand and then sequentially add to 
        it within the function.

    <p>
        You can also use 
        <code class="written-code">range()</code>
        to create a range object. It takes up to three arguments and has the syntax of 
        <code class="written-code">range(start, stop+1, step)</code>. 
        Use 
        <code class="written-code">list()</code>
        to convert this range object into a list.
