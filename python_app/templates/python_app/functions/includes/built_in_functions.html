    <p>
        Python provides several built-in functions to assist with various tasks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code class="written-code">type()</code> returns the type of an object.</li>
    </ul>
    {% include 'python_app/functions/includes/code_snippets/built_in_1.html' %}
    <ul>
        <li><code class="written-code">print()</code> outputs data to the console.</li>
    </ul>
    {% include 'python_app/functions/includes/code_snippets/built_in_2.html' %}
    <ul>
        <li><code class="written-code">pprint()</code> from the pprint module provides a "pretty-print" of data structures, making them more readable. You will need to import it in your files though.</li>
    </ul>
    {% include 'python_app/functions/includes/code_snippets/built_in_3.html' %}
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">raise SystemExit</code>
            is a way to intentionally stop your Python program. It is similar to calling 
            <code class="written-code">exit()</code>
            or
            <code class="written-code">sys.exit()</code>.
            You might use it when something unrecoverable happens, or to end a script early. It can also help when 
            testing or debugging, allowing you to stop the script once a certain condition is met.
        </li>
    </ul>
