    <p>
        Once a variable is assigned, you can access its value by referencing its name.

    <p>
        Variables in Python have different scopes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local Scope: Variables defined within a function are local to that function.</li>
        <li>Global Scope: Variables defined outside functions are global and accessible throughout the module.</li>
        <li>Nonlocal Scope: Variables defined in enclosing functions can be accessed using the nonlocal keyword.</li>
    </ul>
    {% include 'python_app/variables/includes/code_snippets/nonlocal.html' %}
    <p>
        Use the global keyword to modify global variables inside functions.
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/variables/includes/code_snippets/global.html' %}
    <p>
        Look out for variable shadowing, where a variable in a local scope has the same name as a variable in an outer 
        scope. The local variable "shadows" the outer one. In the following example, the global variable x is shadowed 
        by the local variable x inside 
        <code class="written-code">my_function</code>.
        When used inside the function, it essentially reassigns x to the new value. But outside the function it keeps 
        its original or most recent assignment.
    </p>
