    <p>
        In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that refers to an object or value stored in memory. This allows you to 
        assign descriptive names to data, making it easier to manipulate and reuse values throughout your code. You 
        can create a Python variable by assigning a value using the syntax:
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/variables/includes/code_snippets/syntax.html' %}
    <p>
        Python uses the equal sign (=) as the assignment operator. The variable name is placed on the left side of the 
        =, and the value to be assigned is on the right. Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need 
        to declare their type explicitly. You can reassign a variable to a different value or type by just reassigning 
        it.
