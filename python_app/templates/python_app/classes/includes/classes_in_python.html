    <p>
        In Python, classes are a fundamental part of <dfn title="Object-Oriented Programming">OOP</dfn>. They let you 
        create custom data types that combine data (attributes) and functions (methods) into reusable blueprints for 
        your program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Essentially, a class is a blueprint for a data type, letting you invent your own types and bundle the data and 
        behaviour into a single, reusable structure. For example, you could make a class called Dog, and every 
        individual dog in your program would be created using that template.
