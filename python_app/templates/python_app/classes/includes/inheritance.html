    <p>
        Inheritance is used when creating specialized classes by letting you define a new class based on an existing one.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Dog inherits from Animal class Dog(Animal)
        </li>
        <li>
            super().__init__(name) calls the parent's __init__() it does not take self as an attribute
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        One class can also contain instances of other classes, this is known as composition.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python supports multiple inheritance. This allows one class to combine features from more than one parent class.
