    <p>
        To run a Python script, you need to use the command line (also called the terminal or shell) when in the 
        correct directory and use the following command.

        If your program gets stuck in a loop or takes too long to run, you can forcefully stop it by pressing 
        <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>.
        This sends an interrupt signal to Python and cancels the script. It's especially useful when you are stuck in 
        an infinite loop or your program is waiting for an input that never comes.

        Sometimes you need to pause your program and take a look around to check variable values, understand the flow, 
        or find a bug. That's where breakpoints come in. A breakpoint is an intentional pause in your code that tells 
        the interpreter to stop where it is. This allows you to examine variable values, step through code line-by-line 
        or detect logic errors.
