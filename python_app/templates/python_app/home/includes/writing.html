        Before jumping into writing actual code, it's helpful to outline your logic using 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="#"
            title="Go to the page about pseudocode"
            aria-label="Go to the page about pseudocode"
        >
            pseudocode
        </a>.
        This is plain-language writing that describes what your code is supposed to do, step by step. This helps you 
        focus on the logic first, and worry about the syntax later.

        Comments start with a hash/pound/hashtag # symbol in Python. They're ignored by the interpreter but help you 
        and others understand what your code is doing.

        Indents matter a lot in Python. Whereas JavaScript define blocks of code with curly brackets, Python uses 
        indentation. Stick to four spaces or 1 tab per indent level and pick one (spaces or tabs) and keep to it.

        is the official Python style guide and should be adhered to for best practice and to ensure that your code runs 
        flawlessly. Some basic rules are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use lowercase_with_underscores for function and variable names.</li>
        <li>Use CapitalizedWords for class names.</li>
        <li>Keep lines under 79 characters long.</li>
        <li>Add a blank line between functions for readability.</li>
    </ul>
