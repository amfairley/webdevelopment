        One of Python's biggest strengths is its vast ecosystem of libraries, which are reusable chunks of code that 
        provide tools and functions for everything from math and web development to machine learning and data analysis. 
        Python comes with a standard library that includes modules like 
        <code class="written-code">math</code>,
        <code class="written-code">datetime</code>,
        <code class="written-code">os</code>,
        and 
        <code class="written-code">random</code>,
        which are available without installing anything extra. You can browse the full list of

        in the official Python documentation. For additional functionality, you can install external libraries using 
        Python's package manager, pip. For example, to install the popular requests library, you would run 
        <code class="written-code">pip install requests</code>
        in your terminal.
