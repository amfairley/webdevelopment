    <p>
        In Python, everything is an object, even functions and numbers. This makes the language powerful and flexible, 
        especially for advanced topics like functional programming and 
        <dfn title="object-oriented programming">OOP</dfn>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Object-Oriented Programming in Python revolves around the concept of classes and objects. A class is like a 
        blueprint for creating objectsâ€”instances that contain both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Python 
        allows developers to define their own data types by creating classes, encapsulating related logic and data 
        together in a clean, reusable way. Key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are 
        fully supported in Python, enabling developers to build complex applications that are modular, maintainable, 
        and scalable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because everything in Python is an object, even classes themselves are instances of a special class called 
        <code class="written-code">type</code>,
        allowing for dynamic behavior and introspection. This object model underpins much of Python's flexibility and 
        makes it easy to extend or customize language behavior using techniques like metaprogramming and decorators.
