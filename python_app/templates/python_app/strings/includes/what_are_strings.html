    <p>
        In Python, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters enclosed within single ('), double ("), or triple 
        quotes (''' or """). Triple quotes are particularly useful for multi-line strings. Strings are immutable, 
        meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed. However, you can create new strings based on existing 
        ones.
