    <h4>
        Getting Your Current Working Directory
    </h4>
    <p>
        To find out where your Python script is running:
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/os/includes/code_snippets/directory.html' %}
    <p>
        This returns the <dfn title="current working directory">CWD</dfn> which is the default location for reading or 
        saving files unless you change it.
    </p>
    <!-- Files and Folders -->
    <h4>
        Listing Files and Folders in a Directory
    </h4>
    <p>
        You can use 
        <code class="written-code">os.listdir()</code>
        with any valid path to list its contents.
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/os/includes/code_snippets/list.html' %}
    <!-- Joining -->
    <h4>
        Joining Paths the Right Way
    </h4>
    <p>
        Instead of manually typing folder paths (which can cause problems on different systems), use 
        <code class="written-code">os.path.join()</code>. This ensures your code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/os/includes/code_snippets/join.html' %}
    <!-- Split -->
    <h4>
        Splitting Paths and Filenames
    </h4>
    <p>
        You can break a full path into directory and file parts with:
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/os/includes/code_snippets/split_1.html' %}
    <p>
        Then, to separate the filename from its extension:
    </p>
    {% include 'python_app/os/includes/code_snippets/split_2.html' %}
    <p>
        This is useful when renaming files or filtering for .txt or .jpg.
    </p>
