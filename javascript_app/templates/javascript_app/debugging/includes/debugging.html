    <p>
        Debugging is an essential part of developing with JavaScript, and modern browsers provide powerful tools to 
        help track down bugs and fix issues efficiently. Here's how to make the most of the debugging features 
        available in browser DevTools (usually opened with <kbd>F12</kbd> or Right Click → Inspect → Console/Debugger).
    </p>
    <p>
        You can insert the 
        <code class="written-code">debugger</code>
        statement directly into your JavaScript code. When the browser executes this line, it will pause script 
        execution and open the Sources (Debugger) tab automatically. While paused, you can inspect variables, step 
        through code line by line, and observe the state of your application at that exact point.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also use breakpoints in your code. These are a way to manually tell the browser, "pause here."
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the Sources panel in DevTools.</li>
        <li>Locate your script in the left-hand file tree.</li>
        <li>Click on the line number where you want the execution to pause.</li>
        <li>A blue marker will appear, indicating the breakpoint.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When code execution reaches that line, it will pause just like it would with the 
        <code class="written-code">debugger</code> keyword. Once the execution is paused, you have several control 
        options:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Step over (<kbd>F10</kbd>): Executes the current line and moves to the next one without going into function calls.</li>
        <li>Step into (<kbd>F11</kbd>): If the current line contains a function, it enters into that function to debug inside it.</li>
        <li>Step out (<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F11</kbd></kbd>): If you're inside a function, this finishes it and returns to the parent scope.</li>
        <li>Resume (<kbd>F8</kbd>): Continues execution until the next breakpoint or debugger.</li>
    </ul>
