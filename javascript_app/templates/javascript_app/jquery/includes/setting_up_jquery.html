        You can download JQuery from 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="https://jquery.com/download/"
            title="Go to the download jquery page"
            aria-label="Go to the download jquery page"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
            here
        </a>
        and then do one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Link the JQuery file in your HTML with<code class="written-code">&lt;script src="path/to/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Install with npm in your terminal with <code class="written-code">npm instal jquery</code></li>
        <li>Link to the CDN in your head element with <code class="written-code">&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With the second option, you will need to import jQuery at the top of your JavaScript files:
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/jquery/includes/code_snippets/import.html' %}
    <p>
        It is important to remember that it is considered bad practice to run jQuery code before the HTML page is fully 
        loaded. Running jQuery code before the DOM is ready can lead to errors or unexpected behavior because the 
        elements you're trying to interact with might not be available yet. To ensure that your jQuery code runs after 
        the document has loaded, use the following structure:
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/jquery/includes/code_snippets/load.html' %}
    <p>
        This ensures that the code inside the 
        <code class="written-code">$(document).ready()</code>
        function will only execute after the DOM is fully loaded, preventing issues where jQuery tries to interact with 
        elements that haven't been rendered yet.
    </p>
