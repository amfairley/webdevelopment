        Firstly, JavaScript files in your project should be kept in a specific folder such as assets/js or static/js.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can include JavaScript directly in you HTML files by wrapping it within a 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
        element. For most purposes this should be placed at the bottom (but still inside) the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;body&gt;</code>
        element so that it is loaded last, ensuring that any elements it targets have already been loaded. Or can be 
        included in the 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;head&gt;</code>
        element or linked to from an external file using 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;script src="filepath/file.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Comments in JavaScript follow this syntax.
    </p>

        The key points to keep in mind whilst writing JavaScript code are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            JavaScript is case sensitive so for example, TIME and Time in JavaScript have two different meanings
        </li>
        <li>
            End each line with a semi-colon (;). This is the JavaScript equivalent of a full stop. Strictly speaking, 
            it is not entirely necessary these days because JavaScript will automatically insert semi-colons when you 
            run it, however this does mean that it will sort of guess and may not get it correct every time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Variables and functions should be named using camel case. This means that they start with a lowercase letter
            and instead of using spaces between each word, the next word starts with a capital letter, such as 
            camelCaseExampleVariable. The ups and downs of the capital letters are said to resemble the humps on the 
            back of a camel, hence the name.
        </li>
        <li>
            JavaScript 
            <dfn title="Lists">arrays</dfn>
            are 0 order. That means if there is a list of 10 numbers. The 
            <dfn title="position">index</dfn>
            of the first number is 0 and the index of the last number is 9.
        </li>
        <li>
