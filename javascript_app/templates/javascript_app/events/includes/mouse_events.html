        The button property of a mouse event returns an integer that represents which mouse button was pressed when the event was triggered.

        You can use this to confirm which mouse button was pressed e.g. 
        <code class="written-code">if (event.button == 1) {}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">clientX</code>
        and 
        <code class="written-code">clientY</code>
        are properties of the mouse event object that provide the horizontal (clientX) and vertical (clientY) 
        coordinates of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered. They return the position of the mouse relative 
        to the viewport (the visible part of the web page). This means the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of 
        the viewport.
