    <p>
        There are some HTML attributes that you can give to elements to link them to a custom function (which we can 
        create later). This custom function will be triggered when the conditions of that attribute are met. The syntax 
        for these are 
        <code class="written-code">&lt;element attribute="custom_Function_Name"&gt;</code>.
        These attributes include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code class="written-code">onmouseover</code> hovering your cursor over the element
        <li><code class="written-code">onmouseout</code> moving your cursor away from the element
        <li><code class="written-code">onclick</code> for when you click on an element
    </ul>
    <p>
        These are similar to the 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="{% url 'CSS_selectors' %}#CSS-selectors-pseudo-classes"
            title="Go to the CSS pseudo class section"
            aria-label="Go to the CSS pseudo class section"
        >
            pseudo classes in CSS
        </a>
        such as 
        <code class="written-code">:hover</code>
        which allows you to add some styling when the element in hovered. But in this case instead of applying styling 
        we will add our own function. This covers everything you could do in CSS such as changing font size or colour, 
        but you can also do things such as displaying hidden elements, playing a sound, or validating form input prior 
        to submission.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is very important to know that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When accessing the event attribute in HTML they follow the syntax of "onevent".</li>
        <li>When accessing the same event in a JavaScript event listener they follow the syntax of "event" (omit the "on").</li>
    </ul>
