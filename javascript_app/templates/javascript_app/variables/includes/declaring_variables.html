    <p>
        There are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript. These are used the first time you mention the variable 
        and is a way of telling JavaScript “Hey, look, here's a new variable I want you to remember.”
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/variables/includes/code_snippets/let.html' %}
    <p>
        let is the main way you will be declaring your variables. The key aspect of let is that it allows you to change 
        the value of the variable later. Think of your health points in a video game, these will need to be updated 
        when you take damage or heal, it wouldn't be useful if the number could never change.
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/variables/includes/code_snippets/const.html' %}
    <p>
        const is used for declaring a constant variable. This is one that will not be able to change later. This is 
        good for defining variables you do not want to get accidentally changed such as settings or fixed numbers. You 
        should prefer this by default and only use let for variables you know you want to change later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another way was
        <code class="written-code">var</code>.
        This was the original way to define variables but as of 2015 is outdated.
