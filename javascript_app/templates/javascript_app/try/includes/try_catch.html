    <p>
        JavaScript is a flexible language, but like any programming language, code can sometimes go wrong. That's where 
        <code class="written-code">try...catch</code>
        comes in. It helps you handle errors gracefully, without crashing your whole program.
        <code class="written-code">try...catch</code>
        is used to run code that might fail and provide a fallback response if an exception is thrown. The syntax is a 
        try block of code followed by a catch block and an optional finally block that runs regardless of an error.
