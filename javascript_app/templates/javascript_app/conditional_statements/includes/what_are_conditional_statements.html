    <p>
        Conditional statements let your code make decisions based on logic or values. They control flow by deciding 
        what code runs and when. They key conditionals are 
        <code class="written-code">if</code>,
        <code class="written-code">else if</code>,
        and 
        <code class="written-code">else</code>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        You can chain multiple else if blocks, but only the first true block will run.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a shorthand for checking for truthiness (Values like 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN are all falsy. 
        Everything else is truthy).
