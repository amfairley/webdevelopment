    <p>
        In the case of multiple else if statements, a switch might make more sense. An example of this is checking if a 
        percentage grade is an A, B, C, D, E etc. They follow the general structure of:
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/conditional_statements/includes/code_snippets/switch_1.html' %}
    <p>
        The final option is 
        <code class="written-code">default</code>
        which covers the else case and it has no break clause. The break clauses make the computer take that case if it 
        matches and skip the rest. You'll notice it starts with 
        <code class="written-code">switch (true)</code>
        which will evaluate the cases against.
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/conditional_statements/includes/code_snippets/switch_2.html' %}
    <p>
        If you want to achieve an "or" statement in a switch, you can stack the cases above one block statement. The 
        following will log “This is a pome fruit”.
