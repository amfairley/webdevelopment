        In JavaScript, the console object provides a powerful way to log messages, display data, and inspect code 
        during development. These console commands are typically used in the browser's developer tools or in a Node.js 
        environment to help developers debug and inspect their code. Here's a breakdown of some of the most commonly 
        used console methods.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 
        <code class="written-code">console.log()</code>
        method is the most basic and widely used command in JavaScript. It outputs the value of a variable or an 
        expression to the console, making it easier to inspect values during code execution.
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/console_commands/includes/code_snippets/console_log_example.html' %}
    <p>
        This method can handle multiple arguments and display them together.
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/console_commands/includes/code_snippets/console_log_multiple_arguments.html' %}
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">console.table()</code>
        is specifically designed to display an array of objects or arrays in a tabular format in the console. This is 
        particularly useful when dealing with large sets of data, as it allows for better readability and structure.
    </p>

    {% include 'javascript_app/console_commands/includes/code_snippets/console_table_example.html' %}
    <p>
        This will output the array in a neat, easy-to-read table format, with each object's properties listed as 
        columns. This makes it much easier to visually inspect data, especially for larger datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        While 
        <code class="written-code">console.log()</code>
        and
        <code class="written-code">console.table()</code>
        are the most common, there are several other useful console methods.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">console.error(variable)</code>:
            Outputs error messages to the console which are often displayed in red for legibility.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">console.warn(variable)</code>:
            Displays a warning message in the console, typically shown in yellow.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">console.info(variable)</code>:
            Outputs informational messages to the console. Similar to 
            <code class="written-code">console.log()</code>,
            but it may display with a different visual style in some browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">console.assert(expression, message)</code>:
            If the expression evaluates to false, it will display the specified message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code class="written-code">console.group()</code>
            and
            <code class="written-code">console.groupEnd()</code>:
            Groups multiple console logs together, making it easier to organize and collapse logs for better 
            readability.
        </li>
    </ul>
