    <p>
        A common way to iterate through arrays is using a for loop. You can see more about 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="#"
            title="Go to the for loops page."
            aria-label="Go to the for loops page."
        >
            for loops
        </a> 
        on its own page.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also use methods such as 
        <code class="written-code">forEach</code>. Here 'fruit' is a temporary variable assigned to represent "thing in
        the list" and could take any name and still work.
