    <p>
        A major part of JavaScript is the ability to target specific parts of the DOM such as an element, class, ID, or 
        integral browser component.
    </p>
    <p>
        The term Global Window Object represents the browser window. You can access things inside it or its own 
        <dfn title="Functions defined within the model">built-in methods</dfn>. Common ones are listed below but a 
        <a 
            class="text-link"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window"
            title="Go to the window page of Mozilla Devs website"
            aria-label="Go to the window page of Mozilla Devs website"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"

    <!--Pop ups-->
    <h4 id="javascript-targeting-the-dom-targeting-parts-of-the-window-pop-ups">Pop-ups</h4>
    <!--window.alert-->
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">
            window.alert('message')
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This window method causes a pop up to appear in the browser containing 'message'. A good use case of this for 
        when you need to display information to the user such as an error occurring or perhaps a confirmation message 
        when a form has been submitted or similar action completed.
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/targeting_the_dom/includes/code_examples/window_alert.html' %}
    <!--window.prompt-->
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">
            window.prompt('Prompt text')
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This window method opens up a dialogue box for the user to enter some information. It will return the string of 
        whatever the user enters or null if it is cancelled.
        
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/targeting_the_dom/includes/code_examples/window_prompt.html' %}
    <!--window.confirm-->
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">
            window.confirm('Confirmation Message')
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This window method opens a pop up for the user to confirm or cancel something. It returns true if confirmed or 
        false if cancelled.
        
        
    </p>

    <!--Window Dimension-->
    <h4 id="javascript-targeting-the-dom-targeting-parts-of-the-window-window-dimensions">Window Dimensions</h4>
    <p>
        In some cases you may want to us the window dimensions, this is the syntax for accessing it. The examples 
        follow syntax for sections not yet covered but they follow the process of assign the value to a variable, get 
        the element that will show the result, and set that element's content to the variable.
    </p>
    <!--window.inner-->
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">
            window.innerWidth
        </code>
        and
        <code class="written-code">
            window.innerHeight
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        These return the viewport size including scroll bars but not toolbars or menus.
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/targeting_the_dom/includes/code_examples/window_inner.html' %}
    <!--window.outer-->
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">
            window.outerWidth
        </code>
        and
        <code class="written-code">
            window.outerHeight
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        These return the total window size including browser interfaces such as menus
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/targeting_the_dom/includes/code_examples/window_outer.html' %}
    <!--URL and Navigation-->
    <h4 id="javascript-targeting-the-dom-targeting-parts-of-the-window-url-and-navigation">URL and Navigation</h4>
    <p>
        It's handy on occasion to be able to get the data from the URL for confirmation or browser manipulation.
    </p>
    <!--window.location-->
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">
            window.location
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This gives full access to the URL info as a location object. You can use 
        <code class="written-code">window.location.href</code>
        to get the full URL from the current page along with 
        <code class="written-code">hostname</code>,
        <code class="written-code">pathname</code>,
        <code class="written-code">protocol</code>,
        <code class="written-code">search</code>
        etc. to get different specific information.
    </p>

    <!--window.history-->
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">
            window.history
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This represents the session history of the browser tab.	You can use 
        <code class="written-code">window.history.back</code>
        or
        <code class="written-code">window.history.forward</code>
        to move the page back or forward one just like the back and forward buttons in your browser. Due to security 
        concerns, you cannot get a list of your URL history through JavaScript.
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/targeting_the_dom/includes/code_examples/window_history.html' %}
    <!--Data Storage-->
    <h4 id="javascript-targeting-the-dom-targeting-parts-of-the-window-data-storage">Data Storage</h4>
    <!--window.localStorage-->
    <p>
        <code class="written-code">
            window.localStorage
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This stores key, value pairs in the browser that stay there after the page is closed. These are used mainly for 
        user preferences. In fact, I use them on this website for the light/dark mode toggle. Otherwise going to a new 
        page would reset it to light mode. My code for this functionality is:
