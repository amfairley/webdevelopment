    <p>
        In JavaScript, while loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition 
        evaluates to true. They're useful when the number of iterations isn't known beforehand, such as when reading 
        user input or waiting for a certain state. They generally look like the following.

        In the example above:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The temporary variable, i, starts at 1.</li>
        <li>The condition i &lt; 10 is checked.</li>
        <li>If true, it logs i and increments it by 1.</li>
        <li>This continues until i reaches 11 (which fails the condition).</li>
    </ul>
