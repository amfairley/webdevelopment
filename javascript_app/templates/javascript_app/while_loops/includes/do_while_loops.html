    <p>
        A 
        <code class="written-code">do...while</code>
        loop is a variation that guarantees at least one execution of the loop body because the condition is evaluated 
        after the code block. The syntax for this is to put a while statement inside a do statement.
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/while_loops/includes/code_snippets/do.html' %}
    <p>
        In the above example, 10 is logged once because it is executed prior to the while loop and then the condition
        of the while loop fails.
