    <p>
        JavaScript objects are a fundamental data type in JavaScript. They are essentially dictionaries; an unordered 
        collection of name/value pairs. To decide if you need to create an object, consider whether you can fit your 
        details into the form of: *objectName* has a(n) *propertyName*. The name of objects take the data type of 
        strings, whereas the values can be any type including a function; which will create an object method.
