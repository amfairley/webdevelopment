    <p>
        Scope is an important concept to understand when using JavaScript. It controls where variables can be accessed 
        or referenced in your code and plays a big role in keeping your programs clean, modular, and bug-free.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a variable is "in scope," you are allowed to reference it and work with it. When a variable is "out of 
        scope," trying to access it will cause an error, usually a 
        <code class="written-code">ReferenceError</code>.
        This is JavaScript's way of saying, "I don't know what you're talking about â€” that variable doesn't exist here."
