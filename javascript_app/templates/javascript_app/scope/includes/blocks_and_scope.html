    <p>
        A block in JavaScript is any code that is wrapped in curly brackets such as:
    </p>
    {% include 'javascript_app/scope/includes/code_snippets/block_1.html' %}
    <p>
        If a variable is declared inside that block, it is “in-scope”. Declaring a variable outside of any blocks is 
        known as a global variable and are said to have global scope and can be accessed anywhere in your JavaScript 
        code. Too many global variables may cause issues in your code due to scope pollution, so if you can, make some 
        of your variables block scoped.
