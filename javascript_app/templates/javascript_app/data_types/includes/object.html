    <p>
        Objects are collections of key-value pairs. Objects are extremely versatile and are the foundation for most 
        JavaScript structures (arrays, functions, etc. are also objects). Objects can be created from other objects, 
        making a secret link between them. If an attempt to access a name fails, the secret linked object will be used.
