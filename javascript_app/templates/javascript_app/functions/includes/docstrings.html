        A docstring is a special type of comment that can be placed above functions (or other code structures) to 
        describe their purpose, parameters, and return values. It is a valuable tool for documenting your code, 
        especially when working in large projects or teams. Docstrings are typically multi-line comments and can even 
        be used by documentation generators to create an automatic reference for your code. It starts with 
        <code class="written-code">/**</code>,
        has each line starting with 
        <code class="written-code">*</code>
        and ends with 
        <code class="written-code">*/</code>.
        Later when you hover over a function you have created, it will display the docstring.
